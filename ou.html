					<h1 style="color:red;text-align:center;">CRICKET ACCESSORIES</h1> <h2> Bat:-</h2><p>But loosely, the method is as follows: A trunk of willow is shaped into roughly cricket bat-sized chunks known as clefts. Before being carved into a more familiar-looking bat shape, their ends are dipped in wax, and they are air-dried for up to a year.The Bats. Shaped something like a paddle, cricket bats are traditionally made of English willow. Light in weight while also tough and shock resistant, willow resists denting or splintering on impact with a ball travelling at high speed.</p> 
					<h2> Ball:-</h2><p>InIn its most common form, a cricket ball is made from layers of twine wound around a cork core, inside a red leather shell. A raised seam of six rows of stitching gives the ball a number of unique aerodynamic qualities, and helps determine its swing, cut and spin.kookaburra cricket balls are manufactured in Australia and are used in Test matches in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe British Cricket Balls Limited - Established in 1760 by the Duke family, the company specialises in manufacturing cricket equipment.</p><h2> Stumps:-</h2><p>The stumps and bails are usually made of wood, most commonly ash, and together form a wicket at each end of the pitch. The overall width of each wicket is 9 inches (22.9 cm). Each stump is 28 inches (71.1 cm) tall with maximum and minimum diameters of 11⁄2 inches (3.81 cm) and 1 3⁄8 inches (3.49 cm).Traditionally stumps and bails are made from wood, but the new flashing wickets are made from a composite plastic, which are embedded with LED lights.</p>
					<h2> Helmet:-</h2><p>Materials used for making cricket helmets are impact resistance materials like ABS Plastic, Fibreglass, carbon fibre, titanium, steel and high density foam etc. Main parts of a cricket helmets are grill (made with steel, titanium or carbon fibre), chin strap, inner foam material, outer impact resistant shell etc.Besides fiberglass and Carbon fiber, two other materials are used for making head protectors- Steel, Titanium. Steel provides strength, but it is cumbersome, Titanium, on the other hand, is light.</p>

					<h1 style="color:red;text-align:center;">BADMINTON ACCESSORIES</h1> <h2>Badminton Racket:-</h2><p>A badminton racket manufacturing method includes an expandable resin placing process that places an expandable resin that expands when heated on an outer periphery of a portion of a joint, the joint being to be installed to reach inside a frame formed with the resin sheet tube and inside a shaft, the portion being to Badminton rackets are light, with top quality rackets weighing between about 70 and 95 grams. Modern rackets are composed of carbon fiber composite (graphite reinforced plastic), which may be augmented by a variety of materials.</p> 
					<h2> Shuttlecock:-</h2><p>A shuttlecock is formed from 16 or so overlapping feathers, usually goose or duck, embedded into a rounded cork base. Feathers are plucked from the wings of a live goose or duck, a method which has been deemed cruel by animal rights activists in recent years. The cork is covered with thin leather.It has 16 goose feathers, sits on a stump of Portuguese cork and flies at up to 300 miles per hour, which makes the badminton shuttlecock one of the more curious pieces of sports equipment to be found anywhere.</p><h2>Grip:-</h2><p>Good rubber badminton grips are usually made of synthetic rubbers, such as polyurethane or PU. Some rubber grips are more spongy than others, they also can be stretched or not during the tying process to alter the girth of the grip.The common material used to produce a good badminton grip is called polyurethane or PU. PU grips provide comfort and acts as a cushion between your fingers and the racket handle. They are also good sweat and shock absorbers.</p>
					<h2>Wrist Band:-</h2><p>Tennis and badminton players can use wrist bands to wipe the sweat off the forehead. This helps to improve vision. They also help to prevent sweat from flowing to the palms of the hand. Wristband and Wrist wraps both are different items.Sweatbands are mainly worn on the forehead or wrist to help absorb perspiration or as fashionable athletic apparel. They can be made from many materials, but the most common materials sweatbands are made from are terry cloth, polyester and nylon.</p>

					<h1 style="color:red;text-align:center;">FOOTBALL ACCESSORIES</h1> <h2> Shin Guard:-</h2><p>A table tennis racket (also known as a "paddle" or "bat") is used by table tennis players. It is usually made from laminated wood covered with rubber on one or two sides depending on the player's grip. Unlike a conventional "racket", it does not include strings strung across an open frame.Modern rackets are composed mainly of graphite, strips of which are wrapped around a racket mould and left to harden. This has allowed racket engineers to design frames by considering the physics of the swing without being inhibited by the structural limitations of wood.</p> 
					<h2>Ball:-</h2><p>The table is 2.74 m (9.0 ft) long, 1.525 m (5.0 ft) wide, and 76 cm (2.5 ft) high with any continuous material so long as the table yields a uniform bounce of about 23 cm (9.1 in) when a standard ball is dropped onto it from a height of 30 cm (11.8 in), or about 77%.All of the modern table tennis tables are manufactured with fiberboard. In most cases, it is probably high-density fiberboard. But if you are building your own to play on at home, you might be able to use medium density fiberboard (MDF) as an alternative. The thickness can be either 1 inch or 0.75 inches</p><h2>Football Cleats:-</h2><p>They're made of plastic and they're really easy to use. You position it over the net at various positions... The height of the net is then adjusted so that the net gauge hangs on the top of the net and the bottom of the net gauge just touches the table surface.The net is another part of the table that stretches across the width of the table and extends six inches over each side with posts at either end. The net is made of a stretchy nylon material and measures six inches from the top of the net down to the table.</p>
