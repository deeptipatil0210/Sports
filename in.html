					<h1 style="color:red;text-align:center;">CARROM ACCESSORIES</h1> <h2> Carrom Board:-</h2><p>The game is usually played on a square board made of plywood, with a pocket in each corner. The dimensions of the standardized board is a 29 inches (74 cm) square playing surface.The standard size carrom board, used in tournaments, is a 74 x 74 cm board with a 5-10 cm border (or 29 x 29 inches with 2-4 inches border).So, where was carrom invented? It is believed to have originated in the Indian subcontinent though under a different name. It is said to be invented by the Indian Maharajas. Most likely it was adapted by the Maharajas from the street-style version of carrom existing at that time.</p> 
					<h2> Carrom Coins:-</h2><p>In carrom, 18 coins (9 of black and 9 of white) are used with one red coin (also termed as queen) and a striker. This means that a good striker and high-quality coins are needed along with a robust carrom board if you want to enjoy this game properly.</p><h2> Carrom Striker:-</h2><p>Striker pieces are used to push the carrom men and the queen across the board to the pockets. The carrom striker normally weighs 35 grams of size 4.1 cm diameter.</p>
					<h2> Carrom Powder:-</h2><p>Fine-grained powder is used on the board to enable the pieces to slide easily. Boric acid powder is the most commonly used for this purpose. The EU has classified boric acid as a "Serious Health Hazard" and states that "this substance may damage fertility or the unborn child".In the UK, many players use a version of anti-set-off spray powder from the printing industry[citation needed] which has specific electrostatic properties with particles of 50 micrometres in diameter. The powder is made from pure, food-grade vegetable starch..</p>

These squares alternate between two colours: one light, such as white, beige, or yellow; and the other dark, such as black or green.Wood is used to manufacture more than 80 percent of todays' chess boards. But wood was not always associated with Chess.Walnut. Probably the most commonly used wood for chessboards is Walnut, usually European Walnut (Juglans regia).</p> 
					<h2> Chess Piece:-</h2><p>chess piece, game piece used for playing chess. Chess pieces are distinguished by appearance and made of rigid material such as wood, ivory, or plastic.

It is usually made from laminated wood covered with rubber on one or two sides depending on the player's grip. Unlike a conventional "racket", it does not include strings strung across an open frame.Modern rackets are composed mainly of graphite, strips of which are wrapped around a racket mould and left to harden. This has allowed racket engineers to design frames by considering the physics of the swing without being inhibited by the structural limitations of wood.</p> 
					<h2> Table Tennis Board:-</h2><p>The table is 2.74 m (9.0 ft) long, 1.525 m (5.0 ft) wide, and 76 cm (2.5 ft) high with any continuous material so long as the table yields a uniform bounce of about 23 cm (9.1 in) when a standard ball is dropped onto it from a height of 30 cm (11.8 in), or about 77%.All of the modern table tennis tables are manufactured with fiberboard. In most cases, it is probably high-density fiberboard. But if you are building your own to play on at home, you might be able to use medium density fiberboard (MDF) as an alternative. The thickness can be either 1 inch or 0.75 inches</p><h2> Net:-</h2><p>They're made of plastic and they're really easy to use. You position it over the net at various positions... The height of the net is then adjusted so that the net gauge hangs on the top of the net and the bottom of the net gauge just touches the table surface.The net is another part of the table that stretches across the width of the table and extends six inches over each side with posts at either end. The net is made of a stretchy nylon material and measures six inches from the top of the net down to the table.</p>
